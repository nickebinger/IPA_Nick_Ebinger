This repository contains code about automated, JSON driven data-visualisation in Adobe After Effects. The code is uploaded as .js files, but please note that the snippets only work as AfterEffects-Expressions.

This Project was developed throughout my graduation project (IPA) during my apprenticeship at the Swiss Federal Office for Customs and Border Security (FOCBS). The Goal was to develop AfterEffects-Templates which facilitate a fast and efficient production of quarterly videos to visualise swiss foreign trade statistics.
